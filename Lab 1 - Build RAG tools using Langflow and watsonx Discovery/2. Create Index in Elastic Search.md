# Create Index in Elastic Search

> ### ðŸ“‚ What is an Index in Elasticsearch?
>
> An **index** in Elasticsearch is like a **database table** that stores your data in a structured way.
> It organizes documents so they can be quickly searched and retrieved.
>
> Each index contains **documents**, which are JSON objects representing your data entries.
>
> Creating an index is the first step to add and search data in Elasticsearch.
>
> You can think of an index as a **special folder** where related information is stored and easily found later.
