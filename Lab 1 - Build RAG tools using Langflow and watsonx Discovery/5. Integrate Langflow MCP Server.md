# Integrate Langflow MCP Server

> [!NOTE]
> ### ðŸ”Œ  **What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?**
>
> The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools.
>
> Itâ€™s designed to standardize how LLMs access and use contextual information, whether youâ€™re:
> - Building an AI-powered IDE  
> - Enhancing a chat interface  
> - Creating custom AI workflows
>
> Think of MCP like a **USB-C for LLMs**â€”one unified, flexible connection to plug into any compatible tool or context source.

> ### ðŸŒ  **Langflow as an MCP**
>
> Langflow is an **MCP** itself â€” meaning you can export your projects as an MCP-compatible server and **integrate it with other tools, agents, or LLM apps** that support the protocol.
>
> In this step, we will learn how to **generate an MCP server** based on our Langflow flow, which weâ€™ll then **use in the next lab for integration with watsonx.Orchestrate**.

## Generate MCP Server

1. Go to the **Langflow home page** by clicking **Starter Project** on your current project file page.
