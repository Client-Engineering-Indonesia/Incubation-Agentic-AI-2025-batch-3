## 📦 Installing the IBM Watsonx Orchestrate ADK

Before installing the ADK, ensure the following software is installed on your system:

### Prerequisites

#### 1. Python
- The ADK is written in Python and requires **Python 3.11 or later**
- The **latest compatible version** is Python **3.13**
- For more information and download, visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### 3.  (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

Use Python's built-in `venv` module to isolate your environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

### Installation Steps

#### 4. Install the ADK with pip

```bash
pip install ibm-watsonx-orchestrate
```

#### 5. Test the Installation

```bash
orchestrate --version
```

## ⚡ Create Workflow

This section demonstrates how to create flows between agents using workflow tools. You can orchestrate agents to work in **sequence** or **parallel** configurations.

## 📥 Import Flow and Agents

### Step 1: Rename Agents with Your Initials

#### A. Compliance Plan Generator Agent

1. Copy the following code
2. Paste inside `Compliance_Plan_Generator_Agent.yaml`
3. Replace `<your initials>` with your actual initials
4. Save the file

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: Compliance_Plan_Generator_Agent_<your initials>
description: >
  A specialized agent that provides a procedure to check compliance.

instructions: |
  Generate procedure or step by step process to ensure that statement given by user is comply with the requirement or existing policy.
  Provide required documents and what contents that needed to perform compliance assessment.

  Output this list clearly. Do not add any other information or perform any other tasks.

llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-2-90b-vision-instruct
style: default
tools:
# - compliance_plan_generator_tools
# - i__get_flow_status_intrinsic_tool__
```

#### B. Compliance System Agent

1. Copy the following code
2. Paste inside `compliance_system.yaml`
3. Replace `<your initials>` with your actual initials
4. Save the file

```yaml
spec_version: v1
kind: native
name: compliance_system_<your initials>
description: >
  You are a compliance system that checks the compliance of documents against a given procedure and references.
instructions: >
  INPUT: The documents given by the user. Try to use the check check_compliance_flow as tools. 
  OUTPUT: results from compliance_Finish_Agent
llm: watsonx/meta-llama/llama-3-2-90b-vision-instruct
style: default
tools:
  - check_compliance_flow_Bisma
  - i__get_flow_status_intrinsic_tool__
```

### Step 2: Import All Components

- Import all agents, tools, and flows at once using the appropriate script:

#### For Environment 1:
```bash
sh import-all_1.sh
```

#### For Environment 2:
```bash
sh import-all_2.sh
```

#### For Environment 3:
```bash
sh import-all_3.sh
```

> 💡 **Tip:** You can import all agents by running the `.sh` script files.

### Step 3: Wait for Import Completion
- Wait until all agents and tools are successfully imported.
