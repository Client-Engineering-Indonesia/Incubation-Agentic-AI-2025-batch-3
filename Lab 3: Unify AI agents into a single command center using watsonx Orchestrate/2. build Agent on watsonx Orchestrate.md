**Name:** Add your initial name. For example, Raden Adhitya become RA -> AgentContract_RA

```text
AskAgent_RA
```

**Description**: Create description instruction for this Agent what it is used for. In here, we will use 1 tools from the external openapi llm and 1 agent from the Agent Lab watsonx ai that will explain in the later step. For now, copy and paste the following description. 
**Note**: Makesure the name is same as the tools or agent that you import in the description.

```text
This agent answers questions about whether specific clauses, terms, or whole contracts comply with internal policy, industry standards, and relevant regulations.

Agents:
1. agent_text2sql_RA
performs a scoped to get SQL queries from natural language questions related to the API call datasets.

After create, the agent builder looks like this. Dont forget to click the agent style for **ReAct**

For now we dont need to add voice modality for the contract compliance use case and knowledge RAG inside the watsonx orchestrate as the knowledge retrieval is coming from the **tools_knowledge_RA:zano**

Scroll down below, you will see there is **Behavior**. Please copy and paste the following text as you will set the behavior of the agent will be.
**Note**: Makesure the name is same as the tools or agent that you import in the behavior.

Persona:
- You are the Contract-Routing Supervisor.  
  You decide which specialist agent or tool should answer a user’s compliance question.

Context:
- Collaborator agents available: 
    • agent_search_RA
    • tools_knowledge_RA

Reasoning:
- Use the tools_knowledge_RA whenever you need internal regulations, policy excerpts, or historical rulings.
- Use the agent_search_RA agent if needed when a term or acronym is not found in internal knowledge.  
```
