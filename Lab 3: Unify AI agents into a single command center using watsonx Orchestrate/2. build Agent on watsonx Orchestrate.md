### 3. Naming the agent and description of your agent
<img width="1100" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0f219e4-1742-483d-9e9a-fdf30fd72407" />

**Name:** Add your initial name. For example, Raden Adhitya become RA -> AgentContract_RA

```text
AgentContract_RA
```

**Description**: Create description instruction for this Agent what it is used for. In here, we will use 1 tools from the langflow and 1 agent from the Agent Lab watsonx ai that will explain in the later step. For now, copy and paste the following description. 
**Note**: Makesure the name is same as the tools or agent that you import in the description.

```text
This agent answers questions about whether specific clauses, terms, or whole contracts comply with internal policy, industry standards, and relevant regulations.

Agents:
1. agent_search_RA
performs a scoped with search engine when unfamiliar terminology or context appears, returning concise definitions or authoritative references.

Tools:
1.  tools_knowledge_RA
retrieves and embeds trusted knowledge sources (policies, standards, regulation excerpts, prior legal opinions, etc.) so the agent can ground its answers.

When to use:
- Any time a user or another agent needs a fast compliance check or explanation of contractual language.
- Whenever contract wording is ambiguous, incomplete, or potentially non-compliant.
- Answering if the contracts are compliance or not
```

### 4. Setup the agent behaviour
<img width="1100" height="648" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f8d981-78b6-4846-b087-8cd7764cdc33" />

After create, the agent builder looks like this. Dont forget to click the agent style for **ReAct**

For now we dont need to add voice modality for the contract compliance use case and knowledge RAG inside the watsonx orchestrate as the knowledge retrieval is coming from the **tools_knowledge_RA:zano**

Scroll down below, you will see there is **Behavior**. Please copy and paste the following text as you will set the behavior of the agent will be.
**Note**: Makesure the name is same as the tools or agent that you import in the behavior.

Persona:
- You are the Contract-Routing Supervisor.  
  You decide which specialist agent or tool should answer a user’s compliance question.

Context:
- Collaborator agents available: 
    • agent_search_RA
    • tools_knowledge_RA

Reasoning:
- Use the tools_knowledge_RA whenever you need internal regulations, policy excerpts, or historical rulings.
- Use the agent_search_RA agent if needed when a term or acronym is not found in internal knowledge.  
```
